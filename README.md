## About
This documentation provides a detailed analysis of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease using a comprehensive dataset. The analysis includes geographic, temporal, data source, data type, confidence intervals, stratification, topic, class, and general data overview. The goal is to provide insights into the distribution and trends of Alzheimer's disease prevalence across various dimensions.

## Problem Statement
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Understanding its prevalence across different geographies, demographics, and time periods is crucial for public health planning and resource allocation. This documentation aims to analyze the available data to uncover patterns and trends in Alzheimer's disease prevalence, providing valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.

## Insights
Through this analysis, we aim to uncover several key insights:
1. Geographic variations in Alzheimer's disease prevalence.
2. Temporal trends in the prevalence data.
3. Differences in data values based on data sources and types.
4. The reliability of the data through confidence interval analysis.
5. Stratification of data by age groups, race, and other demographic factors.
6. Detailed exploration of the topics and classes covered in the dataset.

## Data Analysis and Exploration
### Geographic Analysis
1. Variation in Prevalence Between Locations
-Analysis of Alzheimer's disease prevalence across various locations (LocationDesc) by comparing the Data_Value for each location.
Distinct Locations and Abbreviations
2. Identification of unique locations and their abbreviations (LocationAbbr).
-Data Value Distribution by Geolocation
3. Visualization of how Data_Value varies across different geolocations (Geolocation).
-Confidence Interval Variation by Location
4. Comparison of confidence intervals (Low_Confidence_Limit, High_Confidence_Limit) for each location.
Comparison of Data Value Between Geolocations

Statistical comparison of Data_Value across various geolocations.
Distribution of High Confidence Limits Across Locations

Plotting High_Confidence_Limit for each location to observe upper bounds of the confidence intervals.
