![](image_back.jpg)

## About
This documentation provides a detailed analysis of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease using a comprehensive dataset. The analysis includes geographic, temporal, data source, data type, confidence intervals, stratification, topic, class, and general data overview. The goal is to provide insights into the distribution and trends of Alzheimer's disease prevalence across various dimensions.

## Problem Statement
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Understanding its prevalence across different geographies, demographics, and time periods is crucial for public health planning and resource allocation. This documentation aims to analyze the available data to uncover patterns and trends in Alzheimer's disease prevalence, providing valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals.

## Insights
Through this analysis, the following insights were uncovered;
- Alzheimer's is most common in individuals aged 65 and older and is particularly prevalent among the Hispanic population.
- The disease is more prevalent in the United States, DC, and Territories, with a notable correlation between higher prevalence rates and wider confidence intervals.
- Females are more affected by Alzheimer's compared to males.
- There is a significant caregiving burden, with many patients receiving extensive care from friends or family members.
- A substantial number of patients have experienced cognitive decline or memory loss recently.
- Many patients with Alzheimer's also report high blood sugar levels (without diabetes) and have a history of smoking.
- Depression is a common comorbidity among Alzheimer's patients.

## Skills Demonstration
Through this analysis, the following skills are demonstrated:
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Efficient handling and preparation of large datasets for analysis.
- Statistical Analysis: Use of statistical methods to compare and contrast data values across different dimensions.
- Visualization: Creation of visual aids to help interpret complex data trends and patterns.
- Correlation Analysis: Identification of relationships between data values and their confidence intervals.
- Data Stratification: Analysis of data based on demographic and other stratification categories.
-Comprehensive Reporting: Detailed documentation of findings in a structured and accessible manner.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease, offering valuable insights into its distribution across various geographic locations, time periods, data sources, and demographic categories. The findings can aid in better understanding and addressing the public health challenges posed by Alzheimer's disease, contributing to more informed decision-making and resource allocation. Through this documentation, we have demonstrated the ability to handle complex datasets, perform detailed analysis, and present the results in a clear and meaningful way.
